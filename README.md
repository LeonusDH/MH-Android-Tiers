# Description
Android Tiers Reforged is a total rework of Atlas' and ARandomKiwi's works with the eventual goal to make mechanical colonists and animals as closely linked to RimWorld's core systems as possible while respecting many original mechanics of the mod. Improved performance, dynamic compatibility, and code formatting are key priorities, and the code has undergone a near complete rewrite across the board to these ends.

Android Tiers itself is a mod that intends to add mechanical colonists, animals, and related mechanics to RimWorld to create a completely new playstyle and bring a very different experience to the table.

## Features
* Four tiers of craftable androids to interact, fight, and recruit across 2 new factions and 1 player scenario.
