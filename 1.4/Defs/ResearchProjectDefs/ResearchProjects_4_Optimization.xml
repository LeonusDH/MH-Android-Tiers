		<description>Tier three androids are marked by their scale and sheer capabilities. Dwarfing humans at an average height of 7-9 feet - necessary to contain the vast requisite resources for operation - and intimidating in both strength and acuity, these units are clear evolutions of human design.</description>

		<description>Tier four androids are marked by the possession of an AI persona core. The possession of such a thing greatly reduces the need for space and therefore size and weight. While its capabilities do not inherently exceed that of a tier three, its persona core does undeniably confer benefits.</description>
